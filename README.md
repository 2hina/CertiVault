CertiVault: Secure Hashing and Verification Tool
üåü Project Overview
CertiVault is a portfolio project that demonstrates core principles of data integrity, security, and Web3-inspired verification by implementing a highly efficient SHA-256 hash generator.

This application simulates the foundational step of a decentralized certificate verification system: generating a unique, tamper-proof "fingerprint" of a digital document (in this case, text input). This hash is what would be stored on a decentralized ledger (like IPFS or a blockchain) to ensure the document has not been altered.

The project showcases a strong grasp of:

Modern React development and efficient state management.

Integrating browser-native cryptographic APIs for high security.

Core computer science algorithms (Binary Search) in Python.

‚ú® Features
1. SHA-256 Hash Generation (Web App)
Real-time Hashing: Calculates the SHA-256 hash automatically as the user types, using a debounce function for optimal performance.

Security: Utilizes the browser's native crypto.subtle API, the recommended standard for cryptographic operations on the web.

Copy Functionality: Easily copy the 64-character hash output to the clipboard with a single click.

2. Foundational Algorithm (Python)
Includes a clean, fully commented implementation of the Binary Search Algorithm (binary_search.py) to demonstrate efficiency and algorithmic thinking. The function operates with O(logn) Time Complexity, making it highly scalable for large datasets.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend/Web Application
React 18: For building a modern, component-based user interface.

Tailwind CSS: For utility-first, responsive, and aesthetic styling.

Browser Crypto API: For secure, client-side hashing.
